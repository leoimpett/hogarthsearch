<p><strong>Hogarth Image Search Prototype</strong></p>
<p>Leonardo Impett November 2020</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two ways to try:</p>
<p>1. use the <a href="SearchGallery.html">Gallery View</a>. This loads the whole image dataset of the YCBA (around 11,000 images). You can search using text, but for now the search functionality only reads the titles of the works (so try "Hogarth" and you'll get images of, rather than by, him). Click on an image on the left, and the nearest neighbours will appear in the column on the right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. use the <a href="ClickThrough.html">Click Through View</a>. This loads only 100 images at a time (it's faster to load, but doesn't have search functionality). Click on an image and you'll see other similar images, returned in the same window, which you can then click on, and so on and so on...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB: In both cases, the first result should always be the image you clicked on. This is an indication things are working!</p>
